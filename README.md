# Robo3-solution-for-MARS-area2
This repository contains a solution for the area2 environment of the [MARS simulation](https://github.com/rock-simulation/mars). MARS is a cross-platform simulation created for robotics research, which was developed at the [Robotics Innovation Center of the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI-RIC)](http://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/startpage.html) and the University of Bremen. This solution was written for the robo3 robot and has been tested using version 0.9.0 of the [binary version of MARS](https://github.com/dfki-ric/bagel_wiki/releases). The code in this repository has to be copied inside the folder install\configuration\mars\robo3\1.0.0\python and must be compiled using the MAGIC BAGEL ui to run.
